Description

This project is a comprehensive Node.js application that offers the following features:

    Image Management:
        Add images with descriptions: Users can upload images and provide detailed descriptions for each one.
        Delete and edit images: Users have the ability to delete images they no longer need and edit existing image descriptions.
    User Authentication:
        Secure login: Users can create accounts with usernames and passwords for secure access.
        Forgot password functionality: A robust forgot password system is implemented using Nodemailer. When a user forgets their password, they can request a one-time password (OTP) via email to reset it.

Features

    Image Management:
        Upload images using a user-friendly interface (GUI is assumed for simplicity).
        Store images securely on the server (consider using a cloud storage solution for scalability and reliability).
        Maintain a database of images and their descriptions (e.g., using MongoDB).
    User Authentication:
        Allow users to register for accounts with usernames and passwords.
        Implement industry-standard password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for secure storage.
        Generate and send OTPs via Nodemailer for password resets.
        Impliment jwt Authentication for secure user intration
    Bulk Emailing:
        Integrate with Nodemailer to send emails in bulk.
        Read email addresses from an Excel sheet (consider using a library like xlsx for parsing).
        Craft a well-formatted email template with clear content and a professional design.
        Send personalized emails if desired (e.g., by including user names in the body).
        Important Note: Always obtain explicit consent from recipients before sending bulk emails. Respect anti-spam regulations (e.g., CAN-SPAM Act in the U.S.).

    User Management:
        Registration: Follow the prompts to create a new account.
        Login: Enter your username and password to log in.
        Forgot Password: If you forget your password, request an OTP via email. Enter the received OTP to reset your password.

    Image Management:
        Upload Images: (Specific instructions will depend on your GUI implementation.)
        Edit Descriptions: Modify image descriptions as needed.
        Delete Images: Remove unwanted images.

    Bulk Emailing:
        Prepare Excel Sheet: Create an Excel sheet containing email addresses.
        Trigger Bulk Emailing: (Instructions will depend on your implementation. You might create a separate script or integrate it into the application's existing functionalities.)

Additional Notes

    Replace placeholders like your-username and your-project-name with your actual project details.
    Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    Consider environment variables or a separate configuration file to store sensitive information like database credentials and email server details.
    Implement proper error handling and logging for a robust and user-friendly experience.
    Test your application thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs
